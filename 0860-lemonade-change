Easy
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    bool lemonadeChange(vector<int>& bills) {
        int no_Of_5s = 0;
        int no_Of_10s = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i< bills.size(); i++){
            if(bills[i] == 5){
                no_Of_5s++;
            }
            else if(bills[i] == 10){
                if(no_Of_5s){
                    no_Of_5s--;
                    no_Of_10s++;
                }
                else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            else {
                if(no_Of_10s && no_Of_5s){
                    no_Of_5s--;
                    no_Of_10s--;
                }
                else if(no_Of_5s >= 3){
                    no_Of_5s -= 3;
                }
                else{
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
