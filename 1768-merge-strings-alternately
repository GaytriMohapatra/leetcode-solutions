Easy

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int i = 0, j= 0;
        string res ="";
        while(i<word1.size() && j<word2.size()){
            res += word1[i];
            res += word2[j];
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        while(i<word1.size()){
            res += word1[i];
            i++;
        }
        while(j<word2.size()){
            res += word2[j];
            j++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
